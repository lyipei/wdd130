The number of chairs in the photo symbolizes the total number of transfers we've experienced. This tradition has documented all of my transfers!</p>

We attempted to share the gospel in a simple manner;my companion drew a picture while I explained salvation.</p>

                <p id="p3">It was a faith-building activity. After eight weeks of training my trainee, we returned to the mission office, where our president gave us this game to test our trust in each other. The trainer was blindfolded, and we had to listen to the trainee's instructions to navigate through all the obstacles around the chapel..</p>

                <p id="p7">This is one of my favorite memories with a companion! We were assigned to a straw service, tasked with collecting straw on a sunny day. The funniest moment I still remember vividly is when my companion became intrigued by a duck and decided to play with it. However, the duck turned out to be quite aggressive and started chasing after my companion. As the duck got closer and closer, it suddenly bit my companion's leg!</p>

                <p id="p8"> We brought along some activities and spent time with the elders at Christmas. A member asked us to share the story of Jesus' birth in Taiwanese. Despite my Taiwanese not being as fluent as a native speaker's, I did my best to convey the story. However, at the end of my speech, it became evident that the elders didn't fully understand what I was saying (haha). Thankfully, another member helped me retell the story, ensuring everyone could grasp its meaning.</p>

                <p id="p9">We had a district service assignment that involved visiting a farmer and clearing branches, especially after a rainy day. Because of the distance, a kind member offered to pick us up after we took the train. To our surprise, they arrived in a truck! We piled into the truck bed, feeling a bit like animals. As other cars passed by, we couldn't help but feel a bit embarrassed. </p>
