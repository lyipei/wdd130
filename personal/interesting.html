            <p id="itro">My mission was filled with a myriad of emotions - from the pains of challenges overcome, to the joys of successes achieved, and the fascination of unexpected encounters. Allow me to share some of the most intriguing and memorable tales from my journey. </p>

                    <p>This is our tradition that we take a particular photo at the end of each transfer with district. The number of chairs represents the number of transfers. This picture was taken during my last transfer; therefore, I sat on the 12 chairs. It was super high!</p>

                    <p>On the left side of the picture is my friend, Kiven, who is a high school student, but there's something amiss with his IQ, perhaps closer to that of an elementary school student. We attempted to share the gospel in a simple manner;my companion drew a picture while I explained salvation.</p>

                    It was a faith-building activity. After eight weeks of training my trainee, we returned to the mission office, where our president gave us this game to test our trust in each other. The trainer was blindfolded, and we had to listen to the trainee's instructions to navigate through all the obstacles around the chapel..</p>

                    <p>This is one of my favorite memories with a companion! We were assigned to a straw service, tasked with collecting straw on a sunny day. The funniest moment I still remember vividly is when my companion became intrigued by a duck and decided to play with it. However, the duck turned out to be quite aggressive and started chasing after my companion. As the duck got closer and closer, it suddenly bit my companion's leg!</p>

                        During Christmas, our ward invited us to participate in a service at the elder center, where we brought along some activities and spent time with them. One of the most memorable moments was when a fellow member asked us to share the story of Jesus' birth in Taiwanese. Since my companion's Taiwanese wasn't as proficient as mine, I took the initiative to narrate the story in Taiwanese. 
                        Despite my Taiwanese not being as fluent as a native speaker's, I did my best to convey the story. However, at the end of my speech, it became evident that the elders didn't fully understand what I was saying (haha). Thankfully, another member stepped forward and helped me retell the story, ensuring that everyone could grasp its meaning.</p>

                        We had a district service assignment that involved visiting a farmer and clearing branches, especially after a rainy day. Because of the distance, a kind member offered to pick us up after we took the train. To our surprise, they arrived in a truck! We piled into the truck bed, feeling a bit like animals. As other cars passed by, we couldn't help but feel a bit embarrassed. </p>
