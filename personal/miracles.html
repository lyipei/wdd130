                    <h2>A Taxi Driver's Story</h2>
                    <p>Originally, we planned to take our bicycles on the train to visit our member. However, when we went to the train station to buy tickets, I suddenly learned that bicycles are not allowed on this train. We decided to leave my bike and catch the train to Huatan. 
                        Quickly, I made the decision to return to Changhua to stow my bicycle and then head back to the train station. We only had 8 minutes remaining, and we needed an elevator to transport our bicycles from the third platform to the first. (I couldn't fathom why the elevator at Changhua Railway Station was so small, accommodating only a bicycle! ðŸ˜¤) And then we had three... 
                        So, as we sprinted with all our might, stowing the bike away, the locomotive departed without a backward glance when it was time to board the platform. The next train wouldn't arrive for another 30 minutes, potentially delaying our visit. With no other option, we hailed a taxi. As I stepped into the car, a sudden realization dawned on meâ€”perhaps these were God's plans all along. 
                        My companion greeted warmly as the driver posed a question that intrigued us all: "What do you missionaries do?" With a glimmer of hope, we began sharing messages in the warm confines of the car. Upon reaching our destination, we asked if we could leave our contact information to continue the conversation. His response was enthusiastic: "Sure! I'm very interested!" Observing the kindness in my companion's eyes, I couldn't help but feel that she must have silently exclaimed "YES" within her heart. 
                        Had it not been for the unforeseen obstacles, we wouldn't have opted for a taxi, nor would I have had the opportunity to share the message of Jesus Christ with this newfound acquaintance. Life presents us with myriad choices, but when we make the right ones, Jesus Christ guides us towards our intended destinations.</p>

                    <p>The girl in the middle of the photo, Vicky, is the only one baptized during my mission. Vicky was a high school student introduced to us by her auntie, who is our member. However, Vicky's parents and young brother were not members.
                        Fortunately, Vicky's parents were supportive of her decision and took her to church each Sunday. I am so glad for her choice and felt happiness and spiritual fulfillment in witnessing her baptism.</p>

                    <P>One day, we arrived at the member's home earlier than expected, so we decided to knock on the door ahead of schedule. It was my first time knocking on doors during my mission, and I felt a lot of nervousness.
                       The first door we knocked on didn't receive an answer. At the second door, we encountered a woman who was Catholic. She questioned why we went to church on Sunday instead of Saturday. We shared our beliefs and discussed the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, she was not willing to continue contact with us after our conversation.
                        However, this experience inspired me, as it reminded me of the power and bravery that Jesus has given me.</p>

                    <P>In the top left corner are my trainer and me, while our friend, Brother Wang, is on the top right. The two men at the bottom are members. Brother Wang is what I would call a "golden friend" that I met during my mission. He showed keen interest in all the information we shared and eagerly participated in all the invitations we extended. Wasn't he truly a golden friend?
                        The most memorable moment occurred during the second lesson. Our lesson plan focused on the plan of salvation. At the beginning of the lesson, Brother Wang surprised both my trainer and me by asking what happens after death. His question caught us off guard, but it turned out that our lesson plan perfectly addressed his curiosity and provided answers to his questions.

                    <P>The woman sitting on the left side is my trainee, Sister Hsu. She was a diligent missionary and frequently inspected my work. One day, after completing our rounds around a university and walking home, we passed by a high school on a day off for the students.
                        Suddenly, Sister Hsu squatted down in front of a boy. I was puzzled by her behavior until I realized she was talking to the boy and sharing the gospel with him. We stayed there for 20 minutes, engaging in conversation with the young boy. It was an interesting experience, and I learned that everyone, regardless of gender and age, has the opportunity to know God.</P>

                    <P>The woman on the right in the picture is our friend, Anna. Unfortunately, she fell down, hit her head, and fainted. After Anna regained consciousness in the hospital, she told her daughter, who is a member of our church, that she wanted to be baptized. This came as a huge surprise to her daughter, as she had been inviting her mom for more than 20 years, but Anna had never agreed before.
                        As we taught Anna about the gospel, she shared her experience of what she saw while she was unconscious. She mentioned seeing Jesus and angels in heaven, which strengthened her belief in their existence and the reality of the afterlife.

                        It was a trip we took after returning from a zone conference. I mentioned to my companion that I had a feeling we should spend some time at the train station, and she agreed. After about 8 minutes of waiting, we noticed a man standing nearby who appeared to be sad and lonely. My companion and I exchanged a glance, then made our way over to him.
                        We struck up a conversation with the man, who was receptive and kind. We discussed his beliefs and Jesus Christ, and he seemed genuinely interested in the information we shared. To our surprise, the conversation lasted for half an hour, and he even missed his train. Before parting ways, we exchanged contact information.

                    <h2>A Spirit Around Us</h2>
                    <p>The woman standing in the middle of the picture is one of my friends, Jing, introduced to us by a friend of one of our members. Initially, she always insisted that she wasn't interested in the gospel and asked us not to bother her about it. When we invited her to visit the church, she mentioned that she was too lazy to ride a bicycle to come and also expressed disbelief in the existence of God.
                        Finally, her friend expressed a desire to come to the church and invited Jing to accompany her. Much to our surprise, Jing accepted the invitation and arrived at the appointed time. We introduced her to the chapel and showed her the pictures on the walls. She even had the opportunity to witness a children's baptism. Before we concluded the meeting, we gathered for a prayer and asked Jing how she felt about the entire experience. She responded, "I felt warm, which I haven't felt before." We recognized that as the presence of the Spirit.
                        After that day, Jing continued to attend our Sunday meetings and got to know more friends in the church. We even started praying together every night. It was a truly strong spiritual experience that I felt during my mission.
