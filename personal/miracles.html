                    <h2>A Taxi Driver's Story</h2>
                    <p>Originally, we planned to take our bicycles on the train to visit our member. However, when we went to the train station to buy tickets, I suddenly learned that bicycles are not allowed on this train. We decided to leave my bike and catch the train to Huatan. I made the decision to return to Changhua to stow my bicycle and then head back to the train station. We only had 8 minutes remaining, and we needed an elevator to transport our bicycles from the third platform to the first.And then we had three... So, as we sprinted with all our might, stowing the bike away, the locomotive departed without a backward glance when it was time to board the platform. The next train wouldn't arrive for another 30 minutes, potentially delaying our visit. With no other option, we hailed a taxi. As I stepped into the car, a sudden realization dawned on meâ€”perhaps these were God's plans all along. My companion greeted warmly as the driver posed a question that intrigued us all: "What do you missionaries do?" With a glimmer of hope, we began sharing messages in the warm confines of the car. Upon reaching our destination, we asked if we could leave our contact information to continue the conversation. His response was enthusiastic: "Sure! I'm very interested!" Observing the kindness in my companion's eyes, I couldn't help but feel that she must have silently exclaimed "YES" within her heart. Life presents us with myriad choices, but when we make the right ones, Jesus Christ guides us towards our intended destinations.</p>

                <P id="text3">We arrived early at the member's home and decided to knock on the door ahead of schedule. At the second door, we met a Catholic woman who asked about our church attendance on Sunday instead of Saturday. We shared our beliefs and discussed Jesus Christ's sacrifice. Unfortunately, she wasn't interested in further contact after our conversation. Despite this, the experience reminded me of the power and courage that Jesus has given me.

Brother Wang, a "golden friend" I met during my mission, showed keen interest in all our discussions. One memorable moment was during our second lesson when Brother Wang surprised us by asking about life after death. His question caught us off guard, but our lesson plan addressed his curiosity and provided answers.

                <P id="text7">During a trip following a zone conference, I suggested to my companion that we spend some time at the train station, which she agreed to. After waiting for about 8 minutes, we noticed a man nearby who seemed sad and lonely. Without hesitation, we approached him and engaged in a conversation. Surprisingly, the discussion about his beliefs and Jesus Christ lasted for half an hour, causing him to miss his train.

                    <h2>A Spirit Around Us</h2>
                    <p>The woman standing in the middle of the picture is one of my friends, Jing, introduced to us by a friend of one of our members. Initially, she always insisted that she wasn't interested in the gospel and asked us not to bother her about it. When we invited her to visit the church, she mentioned that she was too lazy to ride a bicycle to come and also expressed disbelief in the existence of God.
                        Finally, her friend expressed a desire to come to the church and invited Jing to accompany her. Much to our surprise, Jing accepted the invitation and arrived at the appointed time. We introduced her to the chapel and showed her the pictures on the walls. She even had the opportunity to witness a children's baptism. Before we concluded the meeting, we gathered for a prayer and asked Jing how she felt about the entire experience. She responded, "I felt warm, which I haven't felt before." We recognized that as the presence of the Spirit.
                        After that day, Jing continued to attend our Sunday meetings and got to know more friends in the church. We even started praying together every night. It was a truly strong spiritual experience that I felt during my mission.
